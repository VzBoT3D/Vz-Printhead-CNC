This duct was designed to fit with Goliath short and watercooled Vz-Hextrudort. It can also be used with other hotends, but you will need to print and scale the spacers [here](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/Vz-Printhead-CNC/blob/main/STLs/fan%20duct%20lower%20body-brace%20Z%20scalable%20spacers.stl) to mount under the printhead.

BOM:

- 4 X Heat insert M3 3mm X 4.5mm 
- M3 6mm Bolt (to mount to dancing man) 
- M3 12mm Bolt (to mount under the printhead. Or longer bolts + spacers if you use a different hotend)
