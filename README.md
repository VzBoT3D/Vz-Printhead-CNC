# The Vz-Printhead

The Vz-Printhead is a light weight (27g full alu, and 22g hybrid carbon fiber+alu) and stiff head made for the VzBoTs, and now for Vcore3 (if using MGN9 X rail). It was designed to be compatible with almost all hotends,
and extruders out there. With the height adjustable fan duct, you can easily change your config without having to re-print a new fan duct.
